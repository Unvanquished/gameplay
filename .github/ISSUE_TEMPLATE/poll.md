*Polls may be started by developers to gauge community support for a
prospective or existing merge request concerning a small change; usually a
moderate update to the default value of a setting that affects the gameplay.
The change as such should be completely described in the issue title; a
rationale may be given in the comments.*

*Polls are neither necessary nor sufficient for making changes to the game.
They support, but do not replace, review and approval of the merge request.*
