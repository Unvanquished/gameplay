# Gameplay

Issue tracker for Unvanquished gameplay related feedback, problems and new ideas.

To have a fruitful discussion, every issue here **must** fall clearly into one
of the following categories:

## Experience

You can talk freely about how you felt during a game of Unvanquished or when
playing in general. You can let us know what was frustrating or enjoyable to
you but please make it clear that these are your feelings and refrain from
including any proposals or ideas in such an issue.

Unlike `Problems`, `Experience` are only for documentation purpose and not answered with solution proposals but it
can help developers and players to come up with or agree with opinions about
the current state of the game. 

`Experience` issues are closed 90 days after last activity. 

**Example:** *When I play as a Dretch late in the match, I feel like I am stuck
and can hardly evolve again.*

## Problem

You can voice the opinion about **one** distinct aspect of the game is badly
balanced or flawed by design. Unlike with `Experience`, please try to be objective
and do not base your contribution only on your personal experience (which we
cannot refute) but on arguments that we can agree with or reject. Please do not
include proposals or ideas in such an issue as we want to discuss your opinion
as such and may want to pursue a different solution than what you have in mind,
even if we agree with your opinion. After an opinion has been discussed, we
will flag it as rejected, controversial or agreed upon. We will close opinions
that are too broadly scoped to lead to agreement, so be as specific as you can.

**Example:** *The Barricade can be circumvented too easily with wall jumps.*

## Idea that solves a problem (Proposal)

You may propose a change addressing **at least one problem issue**, which you must
cite within your issue. We will only discuss your idea, not the problem,
and may accept it for implementation and testing if at least one of the cited problems was accepted and we feel that your idea poses a
well rounded solution. Discussing alternative ideas within such an issue is
not allowed but others may suggest alterations or variants and you may adjust
your initial idea based on those. We will use the same flags as for
opinions to keep track of good ideas even if we can't implement them
immediately.

If none of the cited problems are agreed upon the idea will be closed after 30 days.

**Example:** *Make the Barricade slow and hurt humans walking on top of it.*

## Idea

If you have an idea that goes beyond resolving current perceived or agreed upon
issues you can explain it here. It is permitted to discuss how the idea could
affect the balance of the game **within follow-up comments** but you may never
advertise your idea as fixing a problem within the first post that opens the
issue. An idea must stand on its own and be worthwhile to pursue independently
of the current state of the game.

Ideas that lack effort or details are tagged as such and are closed after 60 days if no more detailed and rounded idea is reached in the comments.

**Example:** *Allow humans to teleport between Telenodes.*
